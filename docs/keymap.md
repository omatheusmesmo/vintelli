# Keymap

The named actions behind every key, the profiles, the IntelliJ reference column and the chords a terminal cannot deliver.

Every key is routed through named actions (IntelliJ action ids such as
`ActivateRunToolWindow` and `SearchEverywhere`) on top of TamboUI
`Bindings`, so a binding change is data, never code. Profiles: `intellij`
(default), `vim`; picked with the `vintelli.keymap` system property. A user
file `vintelli/keymap.properties` inside the config directory is layered on
top in the TamboUI properties format (`moveUp = Ctrl+k`): an action named in
the file loses the profile triggers and keeps exactly the listed ones, other
actions keep the profile bindings. The config directory is resolved from the
`vintelli.keymap.dir` property when set (absolute or relative, useful for
tests), then the shared `vintelli.config.dir` override (system property or
`VINTELLI_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable), then `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (Linux, if
absolute), then `APPDATA` (Windows), then `$HOME/.config`. The user file is validated: unknown action
names fail fast naming the file and the line, a trigger bound to two
different actions fails fast, and actions that must stay reachable while an
input has focus (the palette, the help overlay, the tool window
activations) must keep at least one Ctrl/Alt/F-key chord; bare printable
characters belong to the capturing input.

The keymap is built only for the `--tui` session: headless and MCP-only
processes never read the file, and a malformed file fails the TUI startup
with a one-line message on stderr and exit code 2.

Key actions in the `intellij` profile:

| Action | Keys (active) | IntelliJ reference |
|---|---|---|
| `Activate<Name>ToolWindow` | `Alt+1`..`Alt+4`, or the bare tab shortcut (`1-4`) when no input has focus | `Alt+4` for Run, `Alt+F12` for Terminal |
| `SearchEverywhere` | `Ctrl+P` | `Double Shift` |
| `KeymapHelp` | `F1` | `F1` |
| `moveUp` / `moveDown` | arrow keys (`j/k` in the `vim` profile) | - |
| `quit` | `Ctrl+C` | - |

The command palette lists every action with its active chord and, when it
differs, the real IntelliJ shortcut, filters by label or action id, and runs
the picked action with `Enter`; the help overlay lists the active keymap
(source plus shortcuts). Both stay reachable while an input has focus. Bare
`q` and `Q` no longer quit in any profile (text input stays safe); `j/k`
are reserved for the `vim` profile and the registry never assigns them as
tool window shortcuts.

Chords a terminal cannot deliver, and their alternatives:

- **Double Shift** (Search Everywhere in IntelliJ): needs key release events
  and the Kitty keyboard protocol, which TamboUI 0.6.0 does not support. Use
  `Ctrl+P` to open the command palette.
- **`Ctrl+Shift+A`** (Find Action): `Ctrl+Shift+letter` sends the same bytes
  as `Ctrl+letter` in legacy mode. Use the command palette.
- **`Alt+F12`** (Terminal tool window in IntelliJ): bound in the profile as
  `Alt+2`, but `Alt+digit` is intercepted by default in tmux (`M-1`..`M-9`)
  and ghostty (tab switching). Not the only path: the bare digits still work
  when no input has focus and the palette reaches every action from anywhere.
- **Cmd/Super**: never reaches the application.
- **`Ctrl+I`, `Ctrl+M`, `Ctrl+J`, `Ctrl+H`, `Ctrl+[`**: the same bytes as Tab,
  Enter, Backspace and Escape; never given their own action.

While a tool window with text input claims the keyboard
(`ToolWindow.capturesInput()`), the shell keeps escape and the reserved
keymap chords for itself: `Ctrl+C` goes to the captured input, but
`Alt+<digit>`, `Ctrl+P` and `F1` still drive the shell, so switching never
relies on bare digit keys once an input has focus. Opening an overlay
releases the capture; after closing it the shell keeps the focus until the
tab is reselected.
